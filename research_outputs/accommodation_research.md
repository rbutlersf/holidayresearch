## Key Coordination Notes

### Check-in/Check-out Times

**Important for 7-person group scheduling:**

**Central Italy (Bologna):**
- Typical check-in: 2-4 PM
- Typical checkout: 10-11 AM
- **Issue:** Arriving July 12 from airports (likely mid-day arrival)
  - **Solution:** Request early check-in (often available for additional fee ~€20-30 or complimentary)
  - **Alternative:** Hotel concierge can store luggage if early arrival before normal check-in
- **Next leg:** Checkout July 20 morning, train to Interlaken typically 10-11 AM trains
  - **Solution:** Arrange luggage storage or same-day train departure after checkout

**Interlaken (Switzerland):**
- Typical check-in: 3-4 PM
- Typical checkout: 10-11 AM
- **Arrival:** July 20 afternoon from Italy (~3-4 hour train journey)
  - **Solution:** Check into hotel/rental as soon as possible; may have afternoon/evening free
- **Departure:** July 22 or July 23 morning, train to Budapest (~18-22 hours with connections)
  - **Solution:** Early checkout if morning train preferred; luggage storage available at train stations

**Budapest:**
- Typical check-in: 2-3 PM
- Typical checkout: 10-11 AM
- **Arrival:** July 22 evening or July 23 morning (depending on train schedule)
  - **Solution:** Late check-in should be possible; confirm with property
- **Departure:** July 26 (leaving for next destination or airport)
  - **Solution:** Standard 10 AM checkout; arrange luggage storage if afternoon flight

### Train Station Proximity

**CRITICAL FOR FAMILY:** Distances matter with 7 people + luggage

**Central Italy:**
- Bologna: AC Hotel & Holiday Inn both within 5-15 minute walk
- Bologna: Centro apartments typically 10-15 minute walk to Centrale
- Modena: Most accommodations within 10 minutes to station
- Parma: Most within 10 minutes
- Florence suburbs: 20-30 minute transit to station (more complicated)

**Interlaken:**
- Hotels: Most within 5-10 minute walk to Interlaken West or Ost
- Central apartments: Walking distance to both stations
- Suburban rentals: 10-15 minute bus to stations

**Budapest:**
- Central Pest hotels/apartments: 10-20 minute metro/walk to Keleti station (international trains)
- Riverside hotels: Easier metro access

### Travel Day Logistics for 7 People

**Challenges:**
- 7 people moving through train stations with large luggage
- Kids' fatigue on long travel days
- Timing between checkout and train departure

**Recommendations:**
1. **Hire porter/luggage service** through hotel (typically €50-100 for loading/unloading)
2. **Book mid-day trains when possible** - avoids early 6 AM wake-ups
3. **Leave comfort items accessible** - snacks, entertainment for trains
4. **Confirm luggage storage** at each location for day trips or mid-day arrivals
5. **Book direct trains when available** - reduces transfers/confusion with full group

### Contact Information Template

**For your records, gather:**

| Location | Property Name | Phone | Email | Address |
|----------|---------------|-------|-------|---------|
| Bologna | [Name] | [+39...] | [email] | [Address + postal code] |
| Interlaken | [Name] | [+41...] | [email] | [Address + postal code] |
| Budapest | [Name] | [+36...] | [email] | [Address + postal code] |

## Money-Saving Tips

### Meal Savings with Kitchen Access

**Scenario: 7 people, 14 days with kitchen access**

- **Restaurant meals:** $25-40/person in Italy/Hungary = $175-280/day = $2,450-3,920 for full trip
- **Kitchen + market meals:** $10-15/person = $70-105/day = $980-1,470 for full trip
- **Savings:** $1,000-2,400+ by using rental kitchens

**Specific strategies:**
1. Buy groceries at local markets (much cheaper than restaurants)
2. Prepare breakfasts/packed lunches for train days
3. Eat one nice restaurant meal per day instead of all meals out
4. Picnics work great in Europe - buy cheese, bread, fruit at markets

### Loyalty Program Benefits

- Points for hotel stays earn toward free nights
- Free room upgrades (sometimes available)
- Late checkout privileges (important for morning departures)

**IHG Rewards:**
- Kids eat free at many properties
