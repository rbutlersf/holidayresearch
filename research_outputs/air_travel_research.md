## Multi-City Routing Analysis

### Routing Option 1: Two One-Way Tickets
**Booking**: SFO → Milan one-way + Budapest → SFO one-way
- **Cost**: Typically $750-1,100 + $750-1,050 = $1,500-2,150 per person
- **Total for 7**: $10,500-15,050
- **Advantages**: Flexibility to choose different airlines, optimization by leg
- **Disadvantages**: If first flight delays, second ticket not protected; must check luggage separately at transit point

### Routing Option 2: Full Round-Trip (SFO → Italy → SFO)
**Booking**: Standard round-trip from San Francisco back to San Francisco (but disembarking in Budapest mid-journey not typical)
- **Cost**: Generally more expensive as airlines penalize non-standard routings
- **Not recommended** for your itinerary - requires purchased multi-city or open-jaw ticket

### Routing Option 3: Multi-City Ticket (SFO → Milan → Budapest → SFO)
**Booking**: Single ticket with three segments
- **Segments**:
  1. SFO → Milan (July 11-12)
  2. Milan → Budapest (July 13-23, via ground travel through Central Italy, then flight from Venice/Bologna/Milan to Budapest)
  3. Budapest → SFO (July 25-28)

**Cost Analysis**:
- Some airlines allow multi-city bookings at total cost = average of round-trip fares
- Example: If SFO-Milan $900 + Milan-Budapest $150-250 (intra-Europe flight) + Budapest-SFO $900 = ~$1,950/person
- **Could save 5-15%** vs. booking two separate one-ways if airline's algorithm prices favorably
- Total for 7: ~$13,650-15,750

**Key Advantage**: **SINGLE TICKET PROTECTION** - if first flight delays, entire itinerary protected and rebookable as single unit

**Where to Book Multi-City**:
- **Lufthansa**: Excellent multi-city booking tool; clear pricing transparency
- **United**: Supports multi-city through website
- **Air France**: Good multi-city pricing through website
- **British Airways**: Avios program strong for multi-city awards

### Recommendation: Book as Multi-City if Pricing is Favorable
**Strategy**:
1. Get quotes for multi-city SFO → Milan → Budapest → SFO on Lufthansa and United
2. Compare to two separate one-ways
3. Multi-city saves 5-15% typically AND provides ticket protection
4. If savings minimal (under $200 total for 7), go with two one-ways for maximum flexibility

**Estimated Final Cost with Multi-City Strategy**:
- Outbound (SFO → Milan): $800-1,100/person
- Return (Budapest → SFO): $700-1,050/person
- **Total per person**: $1,500-2,150
- **Total for 7 passengers**: $10,500-15,050
- **Points alternative**: 175,000-200,000 Chase UR points for both legs (@ 3.0 cpp = $5,250-6,000 value)

**Single Reservation Must-Have**:
- Book ALL 7 passengers on ONE reservation
- Guarantees best family seating opportunity
- Facilitates group check-in and potential group upgrade availability

**Recommended Seating**:
- **Row A (seats 1-3)**: 2 adults + 1 teenager
- **Row B (seats 1-3)**: 2 teenagers + 1 child (age 9)
- **Row C (seats 1-3)**: 1 teenager + 1 adult (reserve) + empty/upgrade opportunity
- **Alt Row C**: Remaining teen + another child/family member in 3-seat block

### Baggage Allowance for Group of 7

**Total Baggage Allowance Summary**:

**United/Lufthansa/Swiss/Air France** (Intercontinental Economy):

**Practical Packing**:
- 4-5 large checked bags for family (distribute among 7 tickets)

**Recommendation**: With 7 passengers, you're well-positioned for luggage as each person gets 1 checked + carry-on. Use this efficiently for 14-16 day trip.

### Group Booking Platforms

- Kayak: Helpful for comparing, but requires airline website for actual booking
- Expedia/Travelocity: Offer group booking tools but less transparent on family seating

**Recommendation**: **Book directly with airline** (United or Lufthansa recommended)

## Important Notes & Action Items

### Advance Seat Selection (CRITICAL for Family of 7)

**Step 1: At Booking**
- Select 6-7 seats together in preferred rows
- Airlines allow seat selection immediately on booking
- Confirm all 7 passengers visible on seat map

**Step 2: 24 Hours Before Departure**
- Check-in online via airline app or website
- Verify 7 passengers still in same seating block
- Take screenshot of seat map as backup proof
- If seating changed, contact airline immediately

**Step 3: Arrive Early (3 hours international)**
- Inform gate agent "family party of 7, pre-assigned seating"
- Bring confirmation of seat selections
- Be prepared to politely hold line if seats reassigned

**Carriers with Best Family Seating Track Record**:
1. Lufthansa (most reliable)
2. United (explicitly guarantees, dynamic seat map)
3. Swiss (excellent reputation)

### Connection Considerations with 7 Passengers

**Luggage Through-Checking**:
- When booking SFO → Milan (with connection), confirm luggage checked through to final destination
- With 7 passengers, coordinating luggage collection at connection is extremely challenging
- Request through-checked bags when booking

**Connection Time Recommendations**:
- **Minimum**: 2 hours between flights in Europe (tight but workable)
- **Comfortable**: 3-4 hours for 7-person group with luggage
- **Preferred**: 4+ hours to handle bathroom breaks, stretching, gate changes

**Which Connections to Avoid**:
- Short connections in unfamiliar airports (e.g., 1.5 hours in Madrid)
- Connections requiring changing airlines (luggage often not through-checked)
- Early morning connections requiring pre-dawn airports with children

### Loyalty Program Tracking

**Create Individual Accounts**:
- Open frequent flyer accounts for all 7 passengers (even children)
- Ensure names match exactly as they appear on passports
- Link all accounts before booking

**Seat Preference Notes**:
- Add to each frequent flyer profile:
  - Preferred seats (aisle, window near family, etc.)
  - Meal preferences (vegetarian, nut allergy, etc.)
  - Special assistance needed (wheelchairs, equipment, etc.)

**Award Availability Alerts**:
- Sign up for award seat availability notifications on United, Lufthansa
- Check 65 days and 21 days out (typical release patterns)

### Important Dates to Mark

- **January 20, 2026**: Deadline to book for best January rates
- **January 27, 2026**: If using points, complete transfer by this date
- **May 11, 2026** (60 days out): Confirm reservations, select seats
- **June 27, 2026** (14 days out): Final check of all reservations
- **July 10, 2026** (24 hours out): Online check-in for all 7 passengers
- **July 11, 2026**: Arrive airport 3 hours early for SFO departure
- **July 25, 2026**: Outbound trip complete; reverse procedure for return

### Booking Verification Checklist

Before finalizing any flight booking:

- All 7 passengers listed on single reservation
- Names match exactly with passport information
- Dates correct (July 11-12 outbound, July 25-28 return)
