## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Is the villa worth the extra $1,400-2,100?**
A: YES. This is the centerpiece of your trip. A 12th-century chapel conversion with pool, resort amenities, and concierge services isn't just accommodation - it's an experience. Your family will remember this forever.

**Q: Do we really need a car?**
A: YES for this villa. It's 25 min from Bologna. Taxis for every trip would cost more. Plus car enables grocery shopping (saves $$) and flexibility.

**Q: Can we skip car and choose a city-center accommodation?**
A: You could, but you'd lose the luxury villa experience. If budget is tight, see CAR_RENTAL_AND_VILLA_ALTERNATIVES.md for Parco dei Gessi farmhouse ($1,134-1,890 total) closer to Bologna.

**Q: What if Palazzo di Varignana is fully booked?**
A: I've researched 6 alternatives:
1. Villa Tamburina (same resort, €1,350/night)
2. Villa Amagioia (same resort, €1,350/night)
3. Parco dei Gessi farmhouse ($1,134-1,890 total, UNESCO site)
4. La Collina ($1,512-2,268 total, restored farmhouse)
5. Plus 2 more - see alternatives document

**Q: Should we fly or train Interlaken→Budapest?**
A: FLY. Saves 4-6 hours, easier with luggage, only $425-680 more than train, less exhausting after 8 days of travel.
